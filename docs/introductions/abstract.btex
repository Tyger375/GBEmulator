    Abstract

    As a kid, I used to play with some Nintendo (copyright symbol) consoles like the Wii or the DS and I've always been keen about the games they make.
    This passion for videogames grew on me so that I got interested in the making process of them, leading to game development.
    I never asked myself one question, though, until this year, which is how are these games able to run onto this consoles? and how can people
    make emulators so that I could play on my personal computer?
    Thus, I decided to embrace the unknown world of emulation, because I have always been fascinated by it and always took it for granted.
