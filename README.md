# GBEmulator

**Abstract** \
This project presents the design and implementation of a Game Boy emulator, developed with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of low-level hardware interactions and computer architecture. Particular emphasis was placed on highlighting architectural choices and encouraging reflection on the design decisions behind game console hardware. The emulator successfully runs the original Tetris ROM, achieving full playability after resolving several hardware-level bugs and subtle implementation issues. Overall, the project illustrates both the technical challenges and the valuable learning experiences involved in emulating a constrained, timing-sensitive hardware system.
